# Q9. Design a LibraryMember class that:
# •	Tracks total active members.
# •	Each member has a name and books_borrowed count.
# •	Has a function to borrow books, with borrowing limit common to all.
# •	Allows updating borrowing limit globally.
# •	Has a static function to check if book title is valid (non-empty string, reasonable length).
