# Q8. Create a HotelRoom class that:
# •	Keeps a base price per night (shared).
# •	Each room has room_number, nights_booked, and guest_name.
# •	Has a method to calculate total bill.
# •	Allows updating the base price across all rooms.
# •	Provides a static utility to check if a number of nights is valid (e.g., positive integer only).
