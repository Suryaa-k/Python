# Q2. Write a function operate(device) that calls device.start(). 
# Pass in objects of Car, Computer, and WashingMachine — all of which define a start() method, but share no inheritance relationship. 
# Show that Python’s polymorphism works through behavior, not type.

def operate(device):
    device.start()

class Car:
    def start(self):
        print("Car")

class Computer:
    def start(self):
        print("Computer")

class WashingMachine:
    def start(self):
        print("Washing Machine")

obj = Car()
obj1 = Computer()
obj2 = WashingMachine()

operate(obj)
operate(obj1)
operate(obj2)
